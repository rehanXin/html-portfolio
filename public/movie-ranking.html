    <h1>The Best Movies According to Tanvir</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Spirited Away</h3>
    <p>
      This is actually the best anime movie you can watch. <br />
      Although I watched it many times. Still it is refreshing to watch
      everytime.
    </p>
    <h3>Good Will Hunting</h3>
    <p>
      This another one of my favorites. <br />
      Whenever I feel like I need to get some good life advice I watch this
      movie.
    </p>
    <h3>The secret life of Walter Mitty</h3>
    <p>
      This is probably the film making genius movie I have watched and never
      fails to make you think your priorities in life.
